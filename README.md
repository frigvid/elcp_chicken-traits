# Features

- Volcanic Nourishment.
	Unique to the Kapaku faction. It's a counter-balance to ELCP's overly aggressive nerf of the faction, and simply lets Kapaku get food from the tiles they're actually meant to, relative to the lore and the base game.
- Hobnob's Greed: Strategic.
	A tiered trait that lets you start with some strategic resources at the beginning of the game.
